Features About My Website
=============================

1. Responsive Grid Layout (Flexbox and Grid)
   - Sections like .flexcontainer, #profile, and .experience-container use Flexbox for alignment.
   - Uses grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); to create a two-column responsive grid layout where each column takes equal space.
   - Also uses the transform to create a zoom out effect.

2. Sticky Navigation Bar with Click Animation
   - `.navBar` remains fixed at the top using `position: sticky`, improving user experience.
   - Links and icons respond to hover and clicks with smooth transitions (e.g., scale, color changes).

3. Smooth Scroll Behavior
   - The entire page supports smooth anchor navigation using `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`.

4. Responsive Hamburger Menu for Mobile
   - Implements a `.hamburger-menu` that toggles visibility of `.menu-links` using JavaScript.
   - Click animation is achieved by toggling the `open` class on both menu and icon.

5. Button Styling with Hover Effects
   - `.btn` elements have clear hover feedback using transitions and color changes.
   - Rounded corners and spacing improve readability and interactivity.

6. Hover Effects and Transitions
   - Navigation items, icons, and buttons have interactive hover states using `transition` and `transform`.
   - Improves user engagement through visual feedback.
